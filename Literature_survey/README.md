# Text Generation from Keywords-[link](https://aclanthology.org/C02-1064.pdf/)

- This model considers not only word n-gram information, but also dependency infor- mation between words. Furthermore, it consid- ers both string information and morphological information.

# CONTEXT BASED TEXT-GENERATION USING LSTM NETWORKS-[link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00048.pdf)

- A sequential model of LSTM network is applied with the configuration: Bidirectional LSTM, 256 hidden units, ‘relu’ activation for the inner layers and ‘softmax‘ activation for the outer layer
